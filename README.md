Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies

    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)
